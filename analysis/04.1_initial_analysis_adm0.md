# Analysis at Country Level


Next steps for HAM, using Niger as a use case.

- Start with metrics aggregated at adm0 with a dry mask applied north of 17N.
- Get a list of 10 worst years per indicator (or 35% if fewer than 30 years of data) and report them in a single table (indicators as columns, years as rows)
- Check all the lists of “bad years” for overlap and divergences between indicators (v1/v2 from IRI/WFP, and for each of the indicators)
- For each indicator, map a time series for JAS by aggregating across years (bad, and good) and plotting the two series on a single graph to visually flag divergences between good and bad years
- Map the time series for “bad years” for all indicators to identify timing of each indicator’s peak/floor values

```python
%load_ext jupyter_black
import os
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

```python
pd.set_option("display.float_format", lambda x: "%.5f" % x)
```

```python
data_dir = Path(os.getenv("HAM_DIR"))
```

```python
adm0_indicators = pd.read_csv(data_dir / "merged_indicators_adm0.csv")
```

```python
adm0_indicators
```

```python
# remove values before 1981
adm0_indicators[["year", "mon"]] = adm0_indicators["month"].str.split(
    "-", 1, expand=True
)  # type: ignore
adm0_indicators_jas = adm0_indicators[adm0_indicators["mon"].isin(["07", "08", "09"])]
df_1981_jas = adm0_indicators_jas[(adm0_indicators_jas["year"] >= "1981")]
df_1981_jas
```

```python
# test which indicators have less than 30 years of data

```
